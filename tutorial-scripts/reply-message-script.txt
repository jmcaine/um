I'll start another reply to this message from Gandalf.
<personal reply>
This time, I want my reply to go to Gandalf ONLY, not to the whole group
so I'll click this button to turn the "group" into "just one",
I can toggle this back and forth, but, when I'm done, if it shows "just one",
then the reply will go to Gandalf alone.

This solves a common problem: wanting to respond directly to somebody
but not wanting to make extra effort to do so.

The next video will cover "filtering" and "stashing" messages.
