To create a new message, 
just click the + button in the top left corner
and begin typing your new message.
<First message>
Then, push send.

You'll be asked WHO you want this message to go to.
You can choose individual people as recipients
	OR you can choose "groups", otherwise called "tags"
I'm going to post this message to the "fun" tag, 
	so that everybody subscribed to that tag will see my message.
When I push send, the message is delivered instantly to all. 
I can see it, too, here at the bottom of my "new" messages.

Note that it's perfectly fine to create a new message, 
then click this button to choose your audience,
and THEN finally write your message.
When I push send, the message is delivered.

If I need to edit this message, I can push the edit button
then modify the text, 
<... edited>
then push send again.

If I merely want to change my audience,
I can click this button next to the current recipients
and select more recipients, or remove some current recipients,
so that I get right collection of people for this message,
and take care not to bother the people who don't care!

The next video will cover "replying" to a message.
