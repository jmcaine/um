MAKE a button to set the default reply-to initial state, so that replies will go to the original sender or whole group, by default, based on your setting when you send the message.

SEARCH - replace found terms, in messages, with highlighted versions thereof (https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-e&channel=entpr&q=faster+to+do+text+substitution+in+sqlite3+SQL+or+in+python+regex+after)
	AT THE SAME TIME, get rid of &nbsp; in teaser text creation

BUGS:

	Sometimes getting this, when I've just come back from Admin (task_handler is users() or tags()), ALSO when coming back from an edit-message (task_handler edit_message()):
			File "/home/ohs/um/um/app/messages.py", line 264, in injected_message
				hd.task.state['loaded_msg_ids'].add(hd.payload['message_id'])
				~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
			KeyError: 'loaded_msg_ids'
	SO, CONFIRM that task.finish() is being called, where task is pop()'d

	when you expand a thread (blue), the messages within no longer have "stash" buttons, even in new; at least the acutally-unstashed messages should...

	when editing a message, injects should NOT be processed -- message list will be reloaded when edit is finished and messages (re-)sent, anyway, and underway-task is not 'messages', so task.state is not appropriate to receiving an injection

	Keyboard covers contenteditable at bottom of screen!
		one browser works (perhaps on its own) and one doesn't!?
		g: android keyboard web page viewport bottom javascript

	since messages save periodically while being edited, if another user loads/views a message mid-edit, they see the message before it's finished and sent!

	filter isn't working to narrow drafts list down

	reply to own reply - this creates a reply to self (only) - nobody else gets it; seems like a footgun
		but note - you have to intentionally click to send to "sender only", rather than group, so probably not likely to happen (much)
	auto-save doesn't save attachments that have been added (well... it just doesn't show them, right?  Upon send, I think they show up fine...?  True of an edited message, at least....)
	*** MAYBE just color a message that is "to self" grey text or something, to alert

	"paste" attachments (https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-e&channel=entpr&q=javascript+accept+image+paste+as+file+upload)
		pasting multiple at a time doesn't work
	* "paste" plain text -- DOUBLE-pastes the text (perhaps it's using url-paste logic)
	* pasting images in replies and edits works differently (note duplicate text in pastes, lack of our special handling when pasting images, etc...)
	* new_reply_box.addEventListener('paste', (e) does NOT "run" for a re-loaded page, where the reply box is just re-presented, rather than created afresh.  (This is understandable, but not desirable)

	email regexp is broken: JS Console: "Unable to check <input pattern='(^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$)'> because the pattern is not a valid regexp: invalid character in class in regular expression""
	SAME with phone!

	child's birth-date -- not yet reverted to proper input time....

	PDFs don't embed in some browsers
	TEST improvement made 8/29

use new edit_history and resend_history DB tables!

correctly employ popover API: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API
	DID this with showing bigger images and movies embedded in messages; have NOT converted other kludgey "dialog" use yet.

check TODO_main.py and others in app/



just added line 417 in main.py:
				hd.supertask = admin_users # TODO!!! (change supertask to a stack, and push/pop?!
	* consider the comment - stack?
	* is this even in the jurisdiction...?

SCHEDULING / calendar

??? (maybe not - maybe good that everybody MUST explicitly archive each....) Add "archive all", preferrably (only) to the last message in a thread, to apply archival to the whole thread, once consumed.  This will likely require a "lookahead" to know that the "next" message does not have the same thread_patriarch

Consider other css animations, like "animation-name: slide-in" (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/play)

TEST MULTIPLE open reply drafts - does auto-saving move properly!?
	A: YES! it does!

------------

Videos:
* new message (recipient "tags")
	* "fixing" recipient groups - adding and removing tags to a message already "sent"
* replying (to one or to all)
* filtering messages (NEW, ALL, ...), and stashing messages
* TOP LEFT CORNER is "most common tasks": new message, or search for something
* search
	- filters as you type
	- no need to go to "room" or know "where"
	- YES, combines with filters, so: "This week" + search term will find search term within this week's messages
	- "deep" looks to message's innerds; otherwise, just the "tags" and opening sentence is used
* no "rooms"...
	- simple mesage - tags (filter by typing)

* saving drafts; finding them later via "+" (as "new" message)
* adding attachments
