MAKE a button to set the default reply-to initial state, so that replies will go to the original sender or whole group, by default, based on your setting when you send the message.

VOTING

auto "reminders", and birthdays (based on birth-dates!)


BUGS:

	the very first message in NEW (and maybe elsewhere?), when it's a reply in a thread, does NOT show the prelude italics!

	make the "thread" button show always (not just for a "search"), and maybe put it in the dialog box, instead of inline with other messages?

	when editing a message, injects should NOT be processed -- message list will be reloaded when edit is finished and messages (re-)sent, anyway, and underway-task is not 'messages', so task.state is not appropriate to receiving an injection

	pasting images in replies and edits works differently (note duplicate text in pastes, lack of our special handling when pasting images, etc...)

	"paste" plain text -- DOUBLE-pastes the text (perhaps it's using url-paste logic)

	Keyboard covers contenteditable at bottom of screen!
		one browser works (perhaps on its own) and one doesn't!?
		g: android keyboard web page viewport bottom javascript

	since messages save periodically while being edited, if another user loads/views a message mid-edit, they see the message before it's finished and sent!

	filter isn't working to narrow drafts list down

	new_reply_box.addEventListener('paste', (e) does NOT "run" for a re-loaded page, where the reply box is just re-presented, rather than created afresh.  (This is understandable, but not desirable)

	reply to own reply - this creates a reply to self (only) - nobody else gets it; seems like a footgun
		but note - you have to intentionally click to send to "sender only", rather than group, so probably not likely to happen (much)
	auto-save doesn't save attachments that have been added (well... it just doesn't show them, right?  Upon send, I think they show up fine...?  True of an edited message, at least....)
	*** MAYBE just color a message that is "to self" grey text or something, to alert

	"paste" attachments (https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-e&channel=entpr&q=javascript+accept+image+paste+as+file+upload)
		pasting multiple at a time doesn't work

	email regexp is broken: JS Console: "Unable to check <input pattern='(^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$)'> because the pattern is not a valid regexp: invalid character in class in regular expression""
	SAME with phone!

	child's birth-date -- not yet reverted to proper input time....

use new edit_history and resend_history DB tables!

FAMILY (password) concept from ohs

"internal" links - click link to "go to" a message posted WITHIN Um.

correctly employ popover API: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API
	DID this with showing bigger images and movies embedded in messages; have NOT converted other kludgey "dialog" use yet.

check TODO_main.py and others in app/



just added line 417 in main.py:
				hd.supertask = admin_users # TODO!!! (change supertask to a stack, and push/pop?!
	* consider the comment - stack?
	* is this even in the jurisdiction...?

SCHEDULING / calendar

??? (maybe not - maybe good that everybody MUST explicitly archive each....) Add "archive all", preferrably (only) to the last message in a thread, to apply archival to the whole thread, once consumed.  This will likely require a "lookahead" to know that the "next" message does not have the same thread_patriarch

Consider other css animations, like "animation-name: slide-in" (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/play)

TEST MULTIPLE open reply drafts - does auto-saving move properly!?
	A: YES! it does!

------------

Videos:
* new message (recipient "tags")
	* "fixing" recipient groups - adding and removing tags to a message already "sent"
* replying (to one or to all)
* filtering messages (NEW, ALL, ...), and stashing messages
* TOP LEFT CORNER is "most common tasks": new message, or search for something
* search
	- filters as you type
	- no need to go to "room" or know "where"
	- YES, combines with filters, so: "This week" + search term will find search term within this week's messages
	- "deep" looks to message's innerds; otherwise, just the "tags" and opening sentence is used
* no "rooms"...
	- simple mesage - tags (filter by typing)

* saving drafts; finding them later via "+" (as "new" message)
* adding attachments
