	FAMILY concept from ohs

links (internal and external) in messages


BUGS:
	filter isn't working to narrow drafts list down

	going to admin screen puts admin screen within content area, rather than replacing whole doc main content area

	reply to own reply - this creates a reply to self (only) - nobody else gets it; seems like a footgun
		but note - you have to intentionally click to send to "sender only", rather than group, so probably not likely to happen (much)
	auto-save doesn't save attachments that have been added (well... it just doesn't show them, right?  Upon send, I think they show up fine...?  True of an edited message, at least....)

	"paste" attachments (https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-e&channel=entpr&q=javascript+accept+image+paste+as+file+upload)
		pasting multiple at a time doesn't work

	email regexp is broken: JS Console: "Unable to check <input pattern='(^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$)'> because the pattern is not a valid regexp: invalid character in class in regular expression""
	SAME with phone!

correctly employ popover API: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API
	DID this with showing bigger images and movies embedded in messages; have NOT converted other kludgey "dialog" use yet.

check TODO_main.py and others in app/



just added line 417 in main.py:
				hd.supertask = admin_users # TODO!!! (change supertask to a stack, and push/pop?!
	* consider the comment - stack?
	* is this even in the jurisdiction...?

SCHEDULING / calendar

??? (maybe not - maybe good that everybody MUST explicitly archive each....) Add "archive all", preferrably (only) to the last message in a thread, to apply archival to the whole thread, once consumed.  This will likely require a "lookahead" to know that the "next" message does not have the same thread_patriarch

Consider other css animations, like "animation-name: slide-in" (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/play)

(auto/optional) down-scaling images attached/pasted before upload

TEST MULTIPLE open reply drafts - does auto-saving move properly!?
	A: YES! it does!

------------

Videos:
* new message (recipient "tags")
	* "fixing" recipient groups - adding and removing tags to a message already "sent"
* replying (to one or to all)
* filtering messages (NEW, ALL, ...), and stashing messages
* TOP LEFT CORNER is "most common tasks": new message, or search for something
* search
	- filters as you type
	- no need to go to "room" or know "where"
	- YES, combines with filters, so: "This week" + search term will find search term within this week's messages
	- "deep" looks to message's innerds; otherwise, just the "tags" and opening sentence is used
* no "rooms"...
	- simple mesage - tags (filter by typing)

* saving drafts; finding them later via "+" (as "new" message)
* adding attachments
