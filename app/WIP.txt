BUGS:

	When scrolled all the way down, after stashing a message, a duplicate single message pops up at bottom -- it does not belong, it's a ghost, and if you try to stash it, you'll get an "internal error".

	Keyboard covers contenteditable at bottom of screen!
		one browser works (perhaps on its own) and one doesn't!?
		g: android keyboard web page viewport bottom javascript

	since messages save periodically while being edited, if another user loads/views a message mid-edit, they see the message before it's finished and sent!

	show ONLY tags to which you're subscribed, when showing tags to "send" a message to; but ALSO include all "individual" tags (really?  someday, when multiple campuses are in, will want to constrain individuals to campus, too!)

	filter isn't working to narrow drafts list down

	new_reply_box.addEventListener('paste', (e) does NOT "run" for a re-loaded page, where the reply box is just re-presented, rather than created afresh.  (This is understandable, but not desirable)

	going to admin screen puts admin screen within content area, rather than replacing whole doc main content area

	reply to own reply - this creates a reply to self (only) - nobody else gets it; seems like a footgun
		but note - you have to intentionally click to send to "sender only", rather than group, so probably not likely to happen (much)
	auto-save doesn't save attachments that have been added (well... it just doesn't show them, right?  Upon send, I think they show up fine...?  True of an edited message, at least....)
	*** MAYBE just color a message that is "to self" grey text or something, to alert

	"paste" attachments (https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-e&channel=entpr&q=javascript+accept+image+paste+as+file+upload)
		pasting multiple at a time doesn't work

	email regexp is broken: JS Console: "Unable to check <input pattern='(^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$)'> because the pattern is not a valid regexp: invalid character in class in regular expression""
	SAME with phone!

use new edit_history and resend_history DB tables!

FAMILY (password) concept from ohs

"internal" links - click link to "go to" a message posted WITHIN Um.

emojis

'selection' (in compose_reply)!

audio(mp3) attachments

correctly employ popover API: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API
	DID this with showing bigger images and movies embedded in messages; have NOT converted other kludgey "dialog" use yet.

check TODO_main.py and others in app/



just added line 417 in main.py:
				hd.supertask = admin_users # TODO!!! (change supertask to a stack, and push/pop?!
	* consider the comment - stack?
	* is this even in the jurisdiction...?

SCHEDULING / calendar

??? (maybe not - maybe good that everybody MUST explicitly archive each....) Add "archive all", preferrably (only) to the last message in a thread, to apply archival to the whole thread, once consumed.  This will likely require a "lookahead" to know that the "next" message does not have the same thread_patriarch

Consider other css animations, like "animation-name: slide-in" (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/play)

(auto/optional) down-scaling images attached/pasted before upload

TEST MULTIPLE open reply drafts - does auto-saving move properly!?
	A: YES! it does!

------------

Videos:
* new message (recipient "tags")
	* "fixing" recipient groups - adding and removing tags to a message already "sent"
* replying (to one or to all)
* filtering messages (NEW, ALL, ...), and stashing messages
* TOP LEFT CORNER is "most common tasks": new message, or search for something
* search
	- filters as you type
	- no need to go to "room" or know "where"
	- YES, combines with filters, so: "This week" + search term will find search term within this week's messages
	- "deep" looks to message's innerds; otherwise, just the "tags" and opening sentence is used
* no "rooms"...
	- simple mesage - tags (filter by typing)

* saving drafts; finding them later via "+" (as "new" message)
* adding attachments
